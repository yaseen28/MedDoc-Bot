| What were the differences between the 2017 US paediatric guidelines and the 2016 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines in terms of blood pressure cut-points for adolescents?                  | The 2017 US paediatric guidelines recommended using US adult cut-points (≥ 130/80 mm Hg) for adolescents starting at age 13, while the 2016 ESH guidelines recommended European adult cut-points (≥ 140/90 mmHg) for adolescents starting at age 16, which is more consistent with physiological body growth.                |
| What is the proposed cut-point for identifying left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) by echocardiography in children?                            | The proposed cut-point for identifying LVH by echocardiography in this age-range is ≥45 g/m^2. Alternatively, LVH may also be defined by the 95th percentile of height normalized for age and sex.                                                                                                                    |
| What are the recommended first-line antihypertensive agents for children and adolescents, and why are beta-adrenergic blockers not typically recommended? | Drug choice should be based on presumed underlying pathophysiology, the presence of concurrent disorders and the availability of appropriate formulations. The recommended first-line antihypertensive agents include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), and diuretics. Beta-adrenergic blockers are not recommended except in specific conditions due to potential side-effects. A stepped-care approach is suggested for choosing antihypertensive agents. |
| Why is early recognition and management of concomitant cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs) important in children and adolescents with hypertension? | Early recognition and management of concomitant CMRFs are important in children and adolescents with hypertension to prevent cardiovascular disease in adulthood.                                                                                                                                                         |
